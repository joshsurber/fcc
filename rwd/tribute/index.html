          <p>My wife's grandpa Joe was born on <datetime>4 October 1942</datetime>. He dropped out of school in fourth grade to get a job.</p>
          <p>He spent his teens in a homeless boys shelter. He wanted out, as well as to serve his country, so he tried to join the military. He was rejected as he was fourteen, so he stole his brother's identity and joined anyway. It took them a year to catch him, and he spent time in the stockade for this.</p>
          <p>One day he was walking home from work when he saw a young lady outside on her porch, and was staring so hard at her he fell down. He told her he was going to marry her. This year would have been their 61 year anniversary.</p>
          <p>Joe was always ready with a story, such as claiming he immigrated from Mexico on a burro named Lulu, who he kept in the back yard. No one understood why as the actual events of his life were larger than life.</p>
          <p>He died on <datetime>19 October 2018</datetime>.</p>
