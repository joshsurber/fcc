    <!-- My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header". -->
    <!-- I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here. -->
    <!-- Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar". -->
    <!-- I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link. -->
    <!-- When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page. -->
    <!-- I can watch an embedded product video with id="video". -->
    <!-- My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form". -->
    <!-- Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address. -->
    <!-- The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for. -->
    <!-- The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address. -->
    <!-- Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit". -->
    <!-- When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit). -->
    <!-- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport. -->
    <!-- My product landing page should have at least one media query. -->
    <!-- My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once. -->
